A theme that allows easy skinning. The currently available skins are:
- Dracula

## How to create a new skin
Copy one of the existing files in the **skins** folder and make the desired changes. Running the **build.sh** bash script will generate a theme file with the same name in the **output folder**.

The new theme can be deployed by adding adding a JSON object in the **Themes** array of the **package.json** file.
